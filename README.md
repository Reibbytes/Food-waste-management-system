# Food-waste-management-system
This project aims to reduce food waste in Hotels and Restaurants through a web application. Users can register, log in, and access a dashboard with forms to record food waste, cook waste, and item waste. The system tracks and analyzes waste data, generating reports in table and chart formats.
